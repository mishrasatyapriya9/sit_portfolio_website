          <p class="obj">Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen
    mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Androidâ€™s user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch
    gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects,
    along with a virtual keyboard for text input.
    In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android
    Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles,
    digital cameras, and other electronics.
    Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems of any kind. Android has been the best selling OS on tablets since
    2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))
